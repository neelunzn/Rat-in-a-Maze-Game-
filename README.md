# Rat-in-a-Maze-Game-
Rat in a Maze Game implementation using C++

“Rat in a Maze” is basically a web based software for game. Here as a player you can play the game following the instruction or quit the game. 
This project has been implemented using C++ language. I have used number of functions, array, attributes etc. The functions I have used in this code are
quite easy to understand. Here I have backtracking for rat position. 

Here are the output of the game-
